/**
 * We expect the path to conform to the following formula:
 *
 *    m × 10^n
 *
 * Where the 10 is omitted and m is a number
 * and n is a negative number.
 *
 * Example: 5 × 10^-2 represents 0.05
 *
 * We will use the power of n as the first operand in the path:
 *
 *   /n/m
 *
 * Since 10 is always the base, we can omit it from the path.
 *
 * And using the power of n as the first operand, we can order
 * the endpoints in a list so we have results in descending order
 * from more likely to less likely: closer to 1 or to 0.
 *
 * The path will be parsed into an array of operands.
 *
 * Example: 5 × 10^-2 (0.05) can be represented with /2/5
